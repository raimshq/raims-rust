Each method returns `ApiResponse<T>` with typed `data`, `last_response` metadata and the original `raw` JSON value. Methods ending in `_with_options` accept `RequestOptions`. Status 202 remains pending and does not start polling.

For cursor lists, `list_pages` creates a lazy `Pager<T>`. `next_page().await` fetches the first page and then advances with the returned cursor; `previous_page().await` navigates back. Filters and options remain attached to the pager. The list response retains its generated `page` type.

Inputs use `Optional::Unset`, `Optional::Null` and `Optional::Value(value)`. Omission and null are separate actions, and null is accepted only where the public contract permits it. Monetary amounts remain integer cents; dates use Unix seconds UTC. Response models accept new fields in `extra_fields` and retain future numeric or string enum values.

## Input parameters

Parameter types are exported in `raims::params`. Every field defaults to `Optional::Unset`. Required fields must be provided before sending a request; validation uses the pinned contract.

### UpdateChargeParams

Update an existing charge.

| Field | Value type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | `String` | No | Charge title. Omit it to keep the current title; send null or empty text to remove it. |
| `description` | `String` | No | Charge description. Omit it to keep the current description; send null or empty text to remove it. |
| `external_reference` | `String` | No | Order or charge reference in your system. Omit it to keep the current value; send null or empty text to remove it. It may be repeated on other charges and is independent of the customer reference. |
| `metadata` | `BTreeMap<String, Option<String>>` | No | Integration data associated with the resource. Supply key and text pairs. Keys are case-sensitive. Omission or {} preserves the data; null removes all pairs, and null for a key removes only that key. Empty text is a valid value. |

### ListChargesParams

List charges.

| Field | Value type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `page_size` | `i64` | No | Charges per page. Positive integers above the maximum use the maximum. Omitted, empty, zero, negative, or invalid values use 10. |
| `after` | `String` | No | Copy page.next_after from the previous response to move forward. Keep the same filters and sort order; do not send before as well. Leave it empty to start the list. |
| `before` | `String` | No | Copy page.previous_before from the previous response to move backward. Keep the same filters and sort order; do not send after as well. Leave it empty if you do not want to go backward. |
| `identifier` | `String` | No | Filter by the complete charge ID. If there is no match, list is empty. |
| `customer_id` | `String` | No | Filter by the customer's complete public ID returned when creating or retrieving the customer. The relationship remains unchanged if the name or email changes. It can be combined with other filters; keep the same customer_id when changing pages. A valid ID with no charges in the authenticated company and environment returns an empty list. An empty or omitted value does not apply the filter. |
| `external_reference` | `String` | No | Filter by the charge's current reference in your system, matching the complete value, including case and accents. An empty or omitted value does not apply the filter. It can be combined with other filters; preserve the value when navigating by cursor. After creating or editing a charge, it may take a few seconds for search to reflect the reference. |
| `email` | `String` | No | Filter by the complete email address recorded on the charge. Editing the customer record does not change that email address. |
| `status` | `String` | No | Filter by one or more comma-separated codes, such as 0,1. 0 created, 1 awaiting payment, 2 authorized, 3 processing, 4 paid, 5 partially refunded, 6 refunded, 7 cancelled, 8 expired, 9 failed, 10 chargeback, 11 chargeback under review, 12 chargeback lost, and 13 chargeback won. Changes may take a few seconds to appear. |
| `payment_method` | `String` | No | Filter by the charge's payment method: 1 for Pix and 2 for boleto. To combine them, send 1,2. A charge with an undefined method may switch to Pix or boleto when the Pix code or boleto is generated in checkout. Selecting a method on the page alone does not change the filter. |
| `created_gte` | `i64` | No | Filter charges created at or after this instant, inclusive, in Unix seconds UTC. If created_lte is supplied, this value must be less than or equal to it. |
| `created_lte` | `i64` | No | Filter charges created at or before this instant, inclusive, in Unix seconds UTC. |
| `due_gte` | `i64` | No | Filter charges due at or after this instant, inclusive, in Unix seconds UTC. It can be combined with due_lte and other filters; preserve the value when changing pages. |
| `due_lte` | `i64` | No | Filter charges due at or before this instant, inclusive, in Unix seconds UTC. If due_gte is supplied, this value must be greater than or equal to it. It can be used alone or with other filters. |
| `paid_gte` | `i64` | No | Filter charges paid at or after this instant, inclusive, in Unix seconds UTC. Uses the confirmed payment date, even if a refund occurred later. Charges without a confirmed payment are excluded. Preserve the value when changing pages. |
| `paid_lte` | `i64` | No | Filter charges paid at or before this instant, inclusive, in Unix seconds UTC. If paid_gte is supplied, this value must be greater than or equal to it. It can be combined with other filters. |
| `sort_key` | `String` | No | Sort by the amount in cents or creation date. If omitted, uses registration order; with a creation-date filter, uses created_at. Keep the same sort order when changing pages. |
| `sort_order` | `String` | No | Set the sort direction. With desc, the default order shows the newest charges first. |

### CreateChargeParams

Create a new charge.

| Field | Value type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `customer_id` | `String` | Yes | ID of a customer in the authenticated company and environment. Copy the id returned when creating or retrieving the customer. Direct Pix requires a valid CPF/CNPJ. Direct boleto requires a name, valid email address, CPF/CNPJ, and address including CEP and street number; complete those fields on the customer record. |
| `amount_cents` | `i64` | Yes | Charge amount in Brazilian real cents. For example, 10000 represents BRL 100.00. |
| `payment_method` | `i64` | No | Charge payment method. Omit it or send 0 to allow selection in checkout. Without payment_method_types, 1 requests Pix and 2 requests boleto at creation, subject to enabled methods. Boleto uses the customer's address and fills missing fields from the CEP when available. With a custom list, send 0 or omit this field; issuance occurs after the checkout selection. |
| `due_date` | `i64` | Yes | Due date in Unix seconds UTC, at least five minutes in the future. The latest date is today plus ten years, using the São Paulo calendar. |
| `title` | `String` | No | Charge title. You may leave this field empty. |
| `description` | `String` | No | Charge description. You may leave this field empty. |
| `send_email` | `bool` | No | With true, requests delivery of the charge to the customer's email address and generates checkout_url. For pending accounts, the customer must use the account's primary email address. Outside that condition, a missing or invalid email prevents delivery but still allows charge creation when there is no direct boleto issuance. Direct boleto requires a valid email even with false. The response does not confirm message delivery. |
| `create_checkout` | `bool` | No | With true, generates the link returned in checkout_url without requiring a return URL or requesting email delivery. With false, the link is still generated when send_email is true or a return URL is supplied. |
| `success_redirect_url` | `String` | No | HTTPS URL on your website for returning after confirmed payment. Redirection does not prove payment; retrieve the charge to confirm it. Credentials in the address, literal IPs, localhost, and Raims domains are not accepted. When supplied, generates checkout_url even with send_email false. If omitted, empty, or null, no return destination is set. |
| `cancel_redirect_url` | `String` | No | HTTPS URL on your website for the payer to return from checkout. Returning does not cancel the charge, Pix, or boleto. Credentials in the address, literal IPs, localhost, and Raims domains are not accepted. When supplied, generates checkout_url even with send_email false. If omitted, empty, or null, no return destination is set. |
| `payment_method_types` | `Vec<i64>` | No | Allowed methods for the charge: 1 for Pix and 2 for boleto. Omission or null uses the inherited checkout settings. Supply a list without duplicates. A custom configuration replaces the account default; a link configuration can only restrict that list. Combine with payment_method omitted or set to 0. |
| `external_reference` | `String` | No | Order or charge reference in your system. Null, empty text, or whitespace leaves it without a reference. It may be repeated and does not prevent duplicate charges. It differs from the reference on the customer record. |
| `metadata` | `BTreeMap<String, Option<String>>` | No | Integration data associated with the charge, as key and text pairs. Keys are case-sensitive. Omission, null, or {} creates the charge without this data; pairs with a null value are not included. Empty text is a valid value. |

### CreateCustomerParams

| Field | Value type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `full_name` | `String` | No | Payer's full name. |
| `tax_id` | `String` | Yes | Valid CPF or CNPJ, with or without periods, slash, hyphen, and spaces. |

| `dial_code` | `String` | No | International dialing code. It may be supplied without phone_local. |
| `phone_local` | `String` | No | Phone number without the dialing code, with or without punctuation. It may be supplied without dial_code. |
| `zip_code` | `String` | No | Address CEP, with or without a hyphen. If street, neigh, city, uf, street_number, and complement are empty, the CEP may populate street, neighborhood, city, and state. It does not populate the street number or address complement. |
| `street` | `String` | No | Address street. |
| `street_number` | `String` | No | Address street number. |
| `complement` | `String` | No | Address complement. |
| `neigh` | `String` | No | Address neighborhood. |
| `city` | `String` | No | Address city. |
| `uf` | `String` | No | State abbreviation, such as SP. |
| `external_reference` | `String` | No | Customer identifier in your system. For an existing customer, omit it to keep the reference, or send null or empty text to remove it. Use external_reference in the customer list to search for this value. |
| `metadata` | `BTreeMap<String, Option<String>>` | No | Integration data associated with the resource. Supply key and text pairs. Keys are case-sensitive. Omission or {} preserves the data; null removes all pairs, and null for a key removes only that key. Empty text is a valid value. |

### ListCustomersParams

List customers.

| Field | Value type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `after` | `String` | No | Copy page.next_after from the previous response to move forward. Use the cursor unchanged, keep the same filters, and do not send before as well. |
| `before` | `String` | No | Copy page.previous_before from the previous response to go back one page. Keep the same filters and do not send after as well. |
| `identifier` | `String` | No | Customer's public identifier, with the cus_ prefix. |
| `name` | `String` | No | Search by customer name, with the newest records first. Leave it empty to ignore this filter. |
| `email` | `String` | No | Filter by the customer's complete email address. |
| `document` | `String` | No | Filter by the customer's complete CPF or CNPJ, with or without periods, slash, hyphen, and spaces. |
| `external_reference` | `String` | No | Filter by the customer's current reference in your system, matching the complete value, including case and accents. It can be combined with other filters. After creating or editing the customer, search may take a few seconds to reflect the reference. Preserve the value when navigating by cursor. |

### DeleteCustomersBatchParams
